  This program is intended to transform an output of Tracking_bigraph library into an easily modifiable template of an OCaml program using Policy library.
  The output of this file is a single file containing a module, functions and transition matrix.
  Arg1 - states file (generated by Trackign_bigraph library).
  Arg2 - transitions file (generated by Trackign_bigraph library).
  Arg3 - a csv file containing a mapping of transition names to time they require.
  Arg4 - a csv file containing a controls (in bigraphical sense) that may represent agents.
  Arg5 - the name of the output file.
  Arg6 - number of agents in states.
